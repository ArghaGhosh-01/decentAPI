## Introduction

Central servers are increasingly prone to crashes, corruption, and hacks due to reliance on a single database. In today's digital era, APIs are the backbone of software development, but the current marketplace faces challenges hindering innovation, transparency, and accessibility. We've built decentAPI to address these issues, providing a decentralized platform that is cost-effective and trustworthy.

## Features

- **Decentralized Marketplace**: A transparent platform for API providers and consumers.
- **Cost-Effective**: Leveraging Etherlink's low transaction fees, enabling affordable interactions.
- **Secure**: Enhanced security through decentralization, reducing the risk of crashes and hacks.
- **Innovative**: Promotes innovation by removing barriers and ensuring accessibility for all developers.

## Architecture

decentAPI is built on Etherlink, a layer 2 blockchain, ensuring low fees and fast transactions. The platform includes the following components:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React, providing a user-friendly interface for interaction with the marketplace.
- **Backend**: Utilizes smart contracts on Etherlink to manage API listings, transactions, and user interactions.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Etherlink blockchain ensures secure and efficient transaction processing.
